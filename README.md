pySensors
=========

This binding allows you to easily access the lm_sensors features from
your Python programs, so that you can get or set information such as
the speed of the fans or hardware temperature on Linux systems. This
is actually a binding for libsensors, the C API from the lm_sensors
project (http://lm-sensors.org).

Name clash
----------

Someone has created another binding called PySensors:
https://bitbucket.org/blackjack/pysensors/
From the look of it, it seems more pythonic and incomplete.

Python 3 support
----------------

The binding has been recently adapted to Python 3. Feedback is
welcome.
