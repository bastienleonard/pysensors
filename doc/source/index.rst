The lm_sensors C library
------------------------

This is really a binding for the lm_sensors C library. Its
`official homepage <http://lm-sensors.org>`_ has been unavailable for a while,
but you can still find extensive information from those links:

* `Arch Linux wiki page <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lm_sensors>`_
* `GitHub project <https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors>`_
* `Copy of the old homepage <https://hwmon.wiki.kernel.org/lm_sensors>`_
