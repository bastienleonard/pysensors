pySensors
=========

This binding allows you to easily access the lm_sensors features from
your Python programs, so that you can get or set information such as
the speed of the fans or hardware temperature on Linux systems. This
is actually a binding for libsensors, the C API from the lm_sensors
project (http://lm-sensors.org).

You can read the documentation online here:
http://pysensors.readthedocs.org/

The source code and the issue tracker can be found here:

Python 3 support
----------------

The binding has been recently adapted to Python 3. Feedback is
welcome.
