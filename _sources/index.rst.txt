   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pySensors's documentation!
=====================================

This binding allows you to easily access the `lm_sensors
<http://lm-sensors.org>`_ features from your Python programs, so that
you can get or set information such as the speed of the fans or
hardware temperature on Linux systems. This is actually a binding for
libsensors, the C API from the lm_sensors project.

Python 3 is supported but still experimental.
